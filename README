What is tab completion: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion

This is a bash-type multi-tab completion code snippet that was written in response to a feature request for the Nodester IRC project: http://irc.nodester.com/. Encouraged by the person that made the feature request, sirkitree (https://github.com/sirkitree) and by alejandromg (https://github.com/alejandromg) from Nodester (https://github.com/nodester), here is the snippet for whomever is interested.

I only tested it on Windows Xp: IE8 version 8.0.6001.18702, FF 11.0 and Chrome 18.0.1025.142 m.
