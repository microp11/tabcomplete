Tab completion is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion

This is a bash-type multi-tab, rotating and case-insensitive completion code snippet, that was written in response to a feature request for the Nodester IRC project: http://irc.nodester.com/. Encouraged by the person that made the feature request, sirkitree (https://github.com/sirkitree) and by alejandromg (https://github.com/alejandromg) from Nodester (https://github.com/nodester), here is the snippet for whomever is interested.

It was tested with IE8 version 8.0.6001.18702, FF 11.0 and Chrome 18.0.1025.142 m on a WindowsXP machine.

The completion source is represented by any string array, e.g., ["Abraham Lincoln", "abacus Moire", "22", "brocard 1", "ab!ba", "crocard", "cribauld", "cronos"]. In our examples, the "nicks" array is either inline or external to the respective html file.

The folder jQueryInline contains code that you can just copy/paste into your own project. This code depends on jQuery.
The jQueryPlugin is, according to sirkitree, its author: "a standalone .js file that could easily be plugged into other people's projects".  
The folder noJQuery, as the name implies, contains code that has no dependency to jQuery.


Usage:
    We want our message to be: "alejandromg, microp11 says hi"
    So we write:
    al <TAB>
    msg: alejandromg
    then we type ", mic" <TAB>
    msg: alejandromg, microp11
    then " says hi"
    so the msg will be "alejandromg, microp11, says hi" :P

Enjoy!
